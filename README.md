a skid of [Medusa](https://github.com/GladUrBad/Medusa) by [Tecnio](https://github.com/tecnio) and [GladUrBad](https://github.com/GladUrBad) (I got permission to use Medusa as a base from Tecnio when he owned Medusa)

its abandoned now

i dont own any of the code, im not responsible for any usage. credit to the original anticheat the checks came from should be commented at the top of the check

dont use. it has a tendency to false basically anything with quite a few bypasses
